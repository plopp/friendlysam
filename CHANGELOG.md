# Friendly Sam change log

## [unreleased] - unreleased

## [0.2.0] - unreleased

### Added
- Added the `MyopicDispatchModel`.
- Added `get_solver()` function.
- Added `resources` property to `Part`.
- Improved expressions and variables: `Sum` class and support for division.
- Added an `evaluators` keyword to `evaluate()`, allowing drop-in of other functions (e.g. `pulp.lpSum` for the `Sum` operation).
- New helper functions for creating piecewise affine functions.
- New time functionality on `Part`. See examples in `tests/test_time.py`.
- A couple of convenience functions added for getting `list` or `pandas.Series` of values from functions like `Node.production[...]()`.
- New optional dependency, pandas.

### Changed
- Changed indexing convention in `VariableCollection`, `ConstraintCollection`, etc, from multi-dimensional to one-dimensional: It is now `func(index)`, not `func(*indices)`.
- Renamed `ResourceNetwork` -> `FlowNetwork`.
- Simplified package structure significantly, resulting in modules and functions being renamed.
- Removed friendlysam.log module.
- Increased friendliness significantly (more consistent and helpful error messages, better `str()` and `repr()` functions, etc).

### Removed
- `Variable` can no longer have constraints. `PiecewiseAffine` class removed as a result.

### Fixed
- Fixed many minor bugs discovered during testing.
