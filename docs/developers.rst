For developers
===========================

Install in developer mode
----------------------------

If you are developing the source code of Friendly Sam, you probably want to install it in "develop" mode instead. This has two benefits. First, you get some extra dependencies such as ``nose`` (testing package), ``sphinx`` (documentation package) and ``twine`` and ``wheel`` (used for releasing), etc. Second, you won't have to reinstall the package into your Python site-packages directory every time you change something.

1. Get `Python 3 <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_. (Note: If you are on Windows it might be convenient to use a ready-made distribution like `WinPython <https://winpython.github.io/>`_ and skip step 5 below, but we can't guarantee it will work.)

2. Download the source code

	* **Alternative 1:** Download a zip file: https://github.com/sp-etx/friendlysam/archive/master.zip

	* **Alternative 2:** If you know git, clone into the repository::

			git clone https://github.com/sp-etx/friendlysam.git

3. You probably want to install Friendly Sam in a :ref:`virtual environment <virtual-environment>`. Create one and activate it before you take the next step.

4. Now, to install Friendly Sam in develop mode, do this::

		pip install -r develop.txt

5. If you are on Windows, ``pip``-installation of some packages will fail if you don't have a compiler correctly configured. One such example is NumPy. A simple way around it is to install binaries from `Christoph Gohlke's website <http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/>`_ for the packages that throw errors when you do ``pip install -r develop.txt``.


Make Sphinx documentation
----------------------------

The documentation for residues is made with `Sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org/latest/index.html>`_ and hosted with `Read the Docs <https://readthedocs.org/>`_. To parse nice, human-readable docstrings, we use `Napoleon <http://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_.

* If you want to make a very minor change to the documentation, you can actually just edit the source, push to the github repository and `magically <http://read-the-docs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/webhooks.html>`_, the docs will update at readthedocs.org.

* However, if you want to edit the docs a lot, you probably want to make test builds on your own machine. In that case, you need to `learn about Sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org>`_. To build the docs, open a command prompt, go to ``friendlysam\docs`` and run the command::

	make html

The resulting HTML can be previewed under ``friendlysam\docs\_build\index.html``.

Releasing Friendly Sam
---------------------------

If Friendly Sam is installed in develop mode, you should already have `twine <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/twine>`_ (for secure communication with PyPI and `wheel <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/wheel>`_ (for building wheel distribution files).

To make a new release on Windows, run in a command prompt::

	release.bat

What it does (at the time of this writing) is this::

	rmdir /S /Q dist
	rmdir /S /Q build
	rmdir /S /Q friendlysam.egg-info
	python setup.py bdist_wheel
	twine upload dist/*

Twine will upload to PyPI and ask you for username and password.

Updating the info on PyPI
----------------------------

To update the info shown on `PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/friendlysam>`_, change the info in ``setup.py``, ``DESCRIPTION.rst`` or whatever, and then run::

	python setup.py register
