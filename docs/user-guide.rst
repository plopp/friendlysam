.. note::

	This user guide is work in progress. Friendly Sam 1.0 will be released in June 2015. Please post any questions or issues on the `Issue Tracker <https://github.com/sp-etx/friendlysam/issues>`_.


You might want to read :ref:`what-friendly-sam-is-for` first.

Now let's get started!

Variables and expressions
----------------------------

In Friendly Sam, each variable is an instance of the ``Variable`` class. Variables can be added, multiplied, subtracted, and so on, to form expressions, including equalities and inequalities.

::

	>>> import friendlysam
	>>> from friendlysam import Variable
	>>> my_var = Variable('x')
	>>> my_var
	<Variable at 0x...: x>
	>>> my_var * 2 + 1
	<Add at 0x...: x * 2 + 1>
	>>> (my_var + 1) * 2
	<Mul at 0x...: (x + 1) * 2>
	>>> my_var * 2 <= 3
	<LessEqual at 0x...: x * 2 <= 3>

In this case, we named the ``Variable`` object ``'x'``. This is nothing more than a string attached to the object, and it does not say anything about the identity of the variable. In principle you can have several ``Variable`` objects with the same name, but that's really confusing and should not be necessary.

::

	>>> my_var = Variable('y')
	>>> my_other_var = Variable('y')
	>>> my_var is my_other_var
	False
	>>> my_var + my_other_var
	<Add at 0x...: y + y>

It is often a good idea to give your variables names you can recognize, because that simplifies debugging when you want to inspect the expressions you have made with the variables. But if you don't want to name variables you don't have to. The variables are then named automatically.

::

	>>> Variable()
	<Variable at 0x...: x1>
	>>> Variable()
	<Variable at 0x...: x2>

There is also a convenient class called ``VariableCollection``. It is a sort of lazy dictionary, which creates variables when you ask for them::

	>>> from friendlysam import VariableCollection
	>>> z = VariableCollection('z')
	>>> z
	<VariableCollection at 0x...: z>
	>>> z(1)
	<Variable at 0x...: z(1)>
	>>> z((1, 'a'))
	<Variable at 0x...: z((1, 'a'))>
	>>> z(None)
	<Variable at 0x...: z(None)>


You can think of ``VariableCollection`` as an indexed variable, but all it really does is to create variables when you call it, and then remember them.

The index must be hashable. For example, tuples are valid indices, but not lists::
	
	>>> z((3, 1, 4))
	<Variable at 0x...: z((3, 1, 4))>
	>>> z([3, 1, 4])
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	...
	TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'


Variables can be named in a namespace, like this::

	>>> from friendlysam import namespace
	>>> with namespace('cheese'):
	...     cheese1 = Variable('gorgonzola')
	...     cheese2 = VariableCollection('ricotta')
	... 
	>>> cheese1
	<Variable at 0x...: cheese.gorgonzola>
	>>> cheese2
	<VariableCollection at 0x...: cheese.ricotta>

The namespace doesn't affect the function of a variable in any way. It only prepends a string representation of whatever object to the variable name, so you can also do things like this::

	>>> with namespace(dict()):
	...     Variable('x')
	... 
	<Variable at 0x...: {}.x>


Optimization problems
-----------------------

We use Friendly Sam to formulate MILP problems. The optimization library could be extended to allow other types of problems, too, but this is what is supported today.

Now, let's begin with a full example of an optimization problem.

	>>> from friendlysam import Problem, Maximize
	>>> 
	>>> # Create the problem
	>>> x = VariableCollection()
	>>> prob = Problem()
	>>> prob.objective = Maximize(x(1) + x(2))
	>>> prob.add(8 * x(1) + 4 * x(2) <= 11)
	>>> prob.add(2 * x(1) + 4 * x(2) <= 5)
	>>> 
	>>> # Get a solver and solve the problem
	>>> solver = friendlysam.get_solver()
	>>> solution = solver.solve(prob)
	>>> type(solution)
	<class 'dict'>
	>>> solution[x(1)]
	1.0
	>>> solution[x(2)]
	0.75

The solver does not in any way affect the problem or the variables. It just reads the problem, solves it and handles back a ``dict`` with your `Variable` objects as keys and their solutions as values.
